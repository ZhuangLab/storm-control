# Qt Thread for handling camera data capture and recording. 
# All communication with the camera should go through this

## CameraControl
#
# Camera update thread. All camera control is done by this thread.
# Classes for controlling specific cameras should be subclasses
# of this class that implement at least the following methods:
#
# getAcquisitionTimings()
#    Returns the current acquisition timings as:
#    [exposure time, cycle time]
#
# initCamera()
#    Initializes the camera.
#
# newFilmSettings()
#    Setup the camera to take the appropriate type of film.
#
# newParameters()
#    Setup the camera with the new acquisition parameters.
#
# run()
#    This is the main thread loop that gets data from the
#    camera and sends signals to the control program that
#    data is available, etc.
#
# See noneCameraControl.py or andorCameraControl.py for examples.
#
#
# This class generates two kinds of Qt signals:
#
# 1. reachedMaxFrames() when the camera has acquired the
#    number of frames it was told to acquire by the
#    parameters.frames.
#
# 2. newData() when new data has been received from the camera.
#    Data is supplied as a list of frame objects as part of
#    the signal.
