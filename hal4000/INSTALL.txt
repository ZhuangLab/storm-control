(1) Install Dependencies:
 (a) Mingw
 (b) Python
 (c) PyQt
 (d) pywin32
 (e) numpy
 (f) scipy (for the optimal focus lock mode)
 (g) pywinusb (for the logitech joystick)
 (h) PyBluez (for bluetooth / android)

(2-3) Note: You should be able to skip the next two steps if you
 are running 64 bit windows as the compiled files are now included in
 the project.

(2) Compile UI elements (in the qtdesigner folder):
 With PyQt you should get a program installed called pyuic.py. Typically
 it can be found in PythonXY\lib\site-packages\pyqt4\uic\. You use it
 like this pyuic.py asdf.ui > asdf.py. You'll need to compile all of the
 following:

 (a) camera-params.ui > camera_params_ui.py
 (b) camera-display.ui > camera_display_ui.py
 (c) focuslock.ui > focuslock_ui.py
 (d) hal4000.ui > hal4000_ui.py
 (e) illumination.ui > illumination_ui.py
 (f) lockdisplay.ui > lockdisplay_ui.py
 (g) spotcounter.ui > spotcounter_ui.py
 (h) stage.ui > stage_ui.py
 (i) progression.ui > progression_ui.py

 If you plan to use the detached camera view, or two cameras you will
 also need to compile these files:
 (a) hal4000-detached.ui > hal4000_detached_ui.py
 (b) camera-detached.ui > camera_detached_ui.py
 (c) camera-params-detached.ui > camera_params_detached_ui.py


(3) Compile C helper libraries:
 Instructions on how to compile the libraries are in the library headers.
 (a) hamamatsu/scmos_image_manipulation.c (for Hamamatsu sCMOS camera).
 (b) objectFinder/LMMoment.c (for the spot counter).
 (c) phreshPhotonics/averager.c (only if you are using their QPD).
 (d) focusLock/focus_quality.c (for optimal focus lock mode)


(4) Add the storm_control directory to your Python path by placing a .pth file in 
 the python install directory, e.g. C:\Python27\. 
 An example .pth file is included under hal4000\storm_control.pth.  

 
(5) Create data & logs directories:
 The default directory for saving data is "c:\users\data\". You can change
 this is in settings xml file. You will also need to create a sub-directory
 of the default directory called "logs", which is where hal (and the other
 programs) will store their log files. If you don't change the default
 directory the full path for the log files is "c:\users\data\logs\".


(6) Verify that the software works:
 The settings_default.xml file contains all the options related to program
 setup and etc. As a first step to verify that the software runs absent
 any hardware issues do the following:

 (a) Set setup_name to none

 Then, in the folder where the hal-4000.py file is located type 
 "python hal-4000.py" to run the program. With these settings the software 
 should start without any warning messages and display a simple pattern in 
 the camera view area.

 This will use the parameters from the none_default.xml file. Other example
 parameter files are labeled prism2_default.xml storm3_default.xml, etc..


(7) Modifying to work with your hardware:
 This is the hard part as it is of course hardware dependent. Python classes
 for control of the hardware that is available in our lab can be found in
 folders that are named (more or less) by the manufacturer of the hardware.
 
 In addition there are the following folders:
 (1) camera - Classes for camera control, image display & parameter display.
 (2) focuslock - Classes for focus lock control.
 (3) illumination - Classes for illumination & shuttering.
 (4) stagecontrol - Classes for controlling a motorized XY stage.
 (5) miscControl - Classes for controlling various miscellaneous hardware
        such as filter wheels.

 In these folders you will see files/Classes that start with a machine name, 
 e.g. storm3IlluminationControl or noneIlluminationControl. You will probably
 need to create your own version of the files specialized to interface with 
 your specific hardware.
